🏛️ JURIS – Court Assistance App
Project Overview

JURIS is a court assistance application developed during my internship.
The primary objective of this app is to provide a clear, structured, and professional legal-tech interface that helps users understand court processes and manage basic case-related workflows efficiently.

The application focuses on simplicity, clarity, and court-grade professionalism, making legal information easier to navigate for users.
